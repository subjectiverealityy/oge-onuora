This is my portfolio website. It is a responsive one-page website that is written in semantic HTML, with UX design thinking in mind.

## Interesting Things To Note About This Project
- I designed the UI of the website by combining fonts, colours and components from two of my previous Figma UI designs.
- 'scroll-behavior: smooth;' was set so that anchor links scroll gently instead of jumping instantly to the target.
- I used two JavaScript `<script>` tags in index.html to write a 'copy to clipboard' function and an 'emphasis animation' function.
- The underlined word,'email', in the last paragraph, triggers an animation in the footer when clicked.
- Most debugging was done with help from ChatGPT and Microsoft Edge's Developer Console.
- In line with semantic HTML, I only used `button`, `span` and `a` where appropriate to do so.
- I decided to create a header for the page _without_ using flexbox or grid layout for a change.
- All outbound links are set to open in a new tab.
- My local folder name for this is 'blue-website'.

As always, I am open to suggestions regarding the repository that you think could improve its maintenance, readability and efficiency down the line. Feel free to send me an email on this and / or any other thing.
